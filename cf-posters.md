# {{ page.title }}

MobiHoc 2018 solicits submissions for a poster session dedicated to sharing late-breaking results or work-in-progress on any topic related to mobile ad hoc networking. Posters provide a chance for in-depth research discussions with other conference attendees and are therefore especially well suited for obtaining feedback on ongoing research or controversial ideas. Please see the call for papers for more guidance on topics of interest at this conference.

## Best Poster

All presented posters will be considered for the Best Poster Award. The winner will be selected at the conference by an award committee.

## Submissions and Selection

Prospective poster presenters should submit a poster abstract with a maximum length of 2 pages, including all figures and references. Poster abstracts must be formatted with the [ACM style sheet](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). The abstract title should begin with `"Poster: "`.  If you are using LaTeX, you can make use of [a simplified ACM conference template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template).  The review is single-blind, that is, the author names should be listed on the submission.  Submissions will be reviewed by a poster selection committee. 

Accepted poster abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings and listed on the conference website. Each accepted poster must be presented in person at the conference. Easels will be provided at the conference for 3x4 feet posters. Please submit your poster abstract on [HotCRP](https://mobihoc18posters.hotcrp.com/).
