ACM MobiHoc is a premier conference with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability.
Examples of such dynamic networks include wired/wireless communication, data-centers, sensors, energy, social, and transportation networks.
Work that presents new performance evaluation methods, novel algorithms or provides fundamental insights for these systems is encouraged.

We are interested both in innovative works in an unexplored and/or emerging topic in the broad area of networks, and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works.
The specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic networks
- Network optimization and learning
- Ultra-wideband and millimeter-wave mobile networking
- Analytical modeling and model validation
- Performance, fundamental limits, scalability, energy, and reliability
- Routing, scheduling, resource allocation, spectrum sharing
- Online algorithms for interacting networks
- Communication and networking aspects of cyber-physical systems
- Anomaly detection, network monitoring and forecasting
- Network games, network economics
- Big data and machine learning in the context of dynamic networks
- Tasks, applications, sensing, and services over networks
- Trust, security, and privacy
- Exciting results from experimental systems
- Internet of the Things (IoT)
- 5G wireless
- Big-data analytics and machine learning for dynamic networks
- Interdependent critical infrastructure networks
- Edge computing and distributed computing over networks
- Software Defined Networking/Network Function Virtualization

Authors can keep their names on their submitted paper, i.e., **submissions are not required to be double blind**.
Authors can also prepare technical reports that are made available on their own websites and on purely archiving organizations such as arXiv.org.
However, all submissions must comply with the [**dual submission policy**](submission.html#dual-submission-policy).
All submitted papers will be considered for a Best Paper Award.
Papers are expected to be direct and specific about their results, contributions, and context.
